# Collaboration Proposal

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to explore the possibility of collaborating with you on an exciting opportunity.

@if($role === 'editor')
As an **Editor**, you will have the ability to make edits and contribute directly to the content we're working on.
@elseif($role === 'viewer')
As a **Viewer**, you will have access to review the content and provide your valuable feedback.
@endif

I believe our combined efforts could lead to great results, and I would love to discuss how we can work together.

Please let me know if you're open to a conversation. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
